# Girl

Your eyes shine brighter than any star  
Your smile is sweeter than a candy bar  
Girl you can just call me Bruno Mars  
Cuz I love you just the way you are  
  
Girl you so fly  
You're like an angel sent from the sky  
Is this real cuz I think I'm in heaven  
From the moment I first saw you at 7-11  
  
Girl you so fine  
I am yours, can you please be mine?  
Can't you see? We're meant for each other  
We look perfect together  
And darling I swear I will love you forever
